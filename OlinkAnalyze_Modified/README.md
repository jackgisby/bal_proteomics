Originally forked from olink's OlinkAnalyze package. Functions have been 
customised/added for exploring and analysing their datasets.

Note that some functions are somewhat hardcoded - e.g. for fixing the return of gene names and the whitespace size in Olink's spreadsheets. See Olink's original package for one that will work on their standard format.
