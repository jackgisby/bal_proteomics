# Proteomics
Scripts for parsing proteomics data - originally forked from Olink's R package. 

Note that some functions are somewhat hardcoded - e.g. for fixing the return of gene names and the whitespace size in Olink's spreadsheets. See Olink's original package for one that will work on their standard format.
